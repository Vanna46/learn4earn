		//Object is a collections of all non-static entities inside a class
		//instance of a class
		//objects occupy memory(Heap)
		//object has a physical form(properties)
		//like identity(Name), state(Color), behavior(Starts)
		//How to create Objects?
		//New Keyword
		//1.ClassName ObjectReference = new ClassName();
		//2.newInstance() method
		//3.clone() Method
		//4.deserialization
		//5.factory methods
		//how to call Objects
		//using the dot (.) operator via object reference
		//obj.ref
		
		//How to initialize objects
		//1. use reference Variable 
		//2. use methods
		//3. use constructor
		
		//What is Constructors
		//A constructor is a block similar to a method but it is not a method
		//A constructor is named exactly as its class
		//A constructor does not have a return type not even void
		//A constructor can use public, private, protected, default Access Modifier
		//A constructor is automatically invoked when we initialize an object
		//for each object created - a Constructor is invoked automatically
		//Types of Constructor in Java
		//1. Default Constructor[No argument] - complier creates this automatically when an object is created
		//2. User-defined[no argument] constructor
		//3. Parameterized Constructor[User-defined]
		
		//Static 
		//it is pre-defined keyword
		//any particular member belongs to a type itself, rather than to an instance of that type
